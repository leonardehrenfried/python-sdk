Raspberry Pi
============

Because of its small size, low price and power consumption and its general
extensibility the Raspberry Pi (or any other similar device) is considered
as an interesting platform for projects related to the Internet of Things.

Updating BlueZ
--------------

The version of BlueZ available for standard distributions for the Raspberry
Pi like Raspbian can be pretty old (before version 5) and unable to handle
Bluetooth LE well, if at all. It is therefore strongly recommended to install
the most recent version using a procedure like the one below (compiling BlueZ
on the Raspberry Pi itself takes about 20-30 minutes):

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt-get --purge remove bluez
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev
	wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.24.tar.xz
	tar xf bluez-5.24.tar.xz
	cd bluez-5.24
	./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-library --disable-systemd
	make
	sudo make install
	sudo cp attrib/gatttool /usr/bin
